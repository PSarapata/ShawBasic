Exercises from Learn Python The Hard Way book by Zed A. Shaw. I've heard good opinions about it and purchased it along with "The next step for new programmers" continuation. Always a good idea to refresh the basics.

First book is quite elementary, we'll see what the other one is. I want to finish those as a filler, as next week (21.02+) I am starting Portfolio Lab with my bootcamp, so I will shortly add some more serious projects to my collection again. :)
